1.ALTER TABLE table_name
DROP COLUMN column_name;

Note: To delete a column in a table, use the following syntax (notice that some database systems don't allow deleting a column)

2.ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD column_name datatype;

Note:To add a column in a table, use the following syntax:

3.ALTER TABLE table_name
RENAME COLUMN old_name to new_name;

Note:To rename a column in a table in SQL Server, use the following syntax:

4.ALTER TABLE table_name
MODIFY column_name datatype;

Note:To change the data type of a column in a table, use the following syntax:


5.UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;

Note:The UPDATE statement is used to modify the existing records in a table.

6)SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=0; used disabled forien key if foreign key is enabled then you may be not able to delete a row from the table 
7)SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=1; used to enabled forien key 
8)The MySQL ORDER BY Keyword  *The ORDER BY keyword is used to sort the result-set in ascending or descending order. *The ORDER BY keyword sorts the records in ascending order by default. To sort the records in descending order, use the DESC keyword.
  ORDER BY Syntax : SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1, column2, ... ASC|DESC;

9)The MySQL LIMIT Clause :The LIMIT clause is used to specify the number of records to return.The LIMIT clause is useful on large tables with thousands of records.
    LIMIT Syntax:SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
LIMIT number;
example: 
SELECT * FROM actor LIMIT 3;

10)The SQL query below says "return only 3 records, start on record 4 (OFFSET 3)":

example:SELECT * FROM actor
LIMIT 3 OFFSET 3;

11)MySQL MIN() and MAX() Functions:The MIN() function returns the smallest value of the selected column.The MAX() function returns the largest value of the selected column.
MIN() Syntax:SELECT MIN(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

12)The MySQL LIKE Operator:The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.

LIKE Syntax
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE columnN LIKE pattern;

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a%';

13)The MySQL IN Operator:The IN operator allows you to specify multiple values in a WHERE clause.The IN operator is a shorthand for multiple OR conditions.

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IN (value1, value2, ...);
or
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IN (SELECT STATEMENT);


14)MySQL Aliases: Aliases are used to give a table, or a column in a table, a temporary name.Aliases are often used to make column names more readable.An alias only exists for the duration of that query.An alias is created with the AS keyword.
Alias Column Syntax :SELECT column_name AS alias_name
FROM table_name;
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name AS alias_name;

***The following SQL statement creates two aliases, one for the CustomerName column and one for the ContactName column. Note: Single or double quotation marks are required if the alias name contains spaces:
Syntax: SELECT CustomerName AS Customer, ContactName AS "Contact Person"
FROM Customers



*******************************************JOINS***************************************************
1)A JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.
a)The INNER JOIN keyword selects records that have matching values in both tables.
syntax:SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

b)CROSS JOIN Syntax: The CROSS JOIN keyword returns all records from both tables (table1 and table2).
Syntex: SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
CROSS JOIN table2;

c)MySQL Self Join: A self join is a regular join, but the table is joined with itself.
syntax:SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1 T1, table1 T2
WHERE condition;

Note:T1 and T2 are different table aliases for the same table.
